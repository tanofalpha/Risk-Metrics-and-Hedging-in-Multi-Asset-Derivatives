This project presents a practical implementation of a multi-asset risk management engine using derivatives, including equity options, bonds, and FX forwards. The objective is to compute risk metrics (Greeks, DV01), simulate portfolio value under shocks,
and construct basic hedging strategies. The project utilizes Black-Scholes pricing, bond PV models, and FX parity relations implemented in Python.
